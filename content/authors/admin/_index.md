Hi there! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I received my B.Eng. in computer science from BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications) in 2019. 

My research interests lie in computer networking and distributed systems. I have also explored other subjects like machine learning and evolutionary game theory.
