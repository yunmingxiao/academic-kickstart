## Prospective Students
---


I am always looking for **highly motivated** students to work on computer systems, networks, and security. Our group currently has openings for **PhD, MPhil, postdoc, research assistant, and visiting positions**. If you are interested, please email me your CV, transcripts, and any materials that showcase your research potential.

For PhD applicants, I look for candidates who:
- Major in Computer Science or related fields from competitive universities, e.g., 985/211 or well-known oversea universities (school requirement);
- Have good academic performance and a solid programming foundation (school requirement);
- Possess experience in research, competitions, or open-source projects (preferred but not required);
- Show strong motivation and commitment to pursuing a PhD and conducting research (**most important**).

For **CUHK-SZ students**, you are very welcome to email me to arrange an in-person meeting.
