Free and open source media centers are currently experiencing a boom in popularity. A complex ecosystem has developed around <a href="https://kodi.tv">Kodi</a>, composed of millions of users, thousands of “add-ons” – Kodi extensions from from 3rd-party developers – and content providers. 

We developed <a href="../../publication/dekodi/">de-Kodi</a> , a full fledged crawling system capable of discovering and crawling large cross-sections of Kodi’s decentralized ecosystem at tunable levels of depth and breadth. With de-Kodi, we discovered and tested over 9,000 distinct Kodi addons. Our work further serves as the first ever transparent and repeatable analysis of the Kodi ecosystem at large.

Futhermore, on top of de-Kodi, we build a Kodi add-on <a href="https://safekodi.com">SafeKodi</a> which helps to protect Kodi users from malacious Kodi add-ons.
