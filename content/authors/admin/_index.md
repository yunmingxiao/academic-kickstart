Hi there! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I'm working at <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern Networks Group</a> and supervised by <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/website/index-a.html">Prof. Aleksandar Kuzmanovic</a>. I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2019. 

My research interests lie in computer networking and distributed systems.
