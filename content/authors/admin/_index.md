Hi there! I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I'm working at <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern Networks Group</a> and supervised by <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/website/index-a.html">Prof. Aleksandar Kuzmanovic</a>. I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2019. 

My research interests lie in computer networking and distributed systems. My current research focuses on two primary directions: (i) enhancing the security and privacy measures of various Internet services, and (ii) advancing the reliability of data center networks, aiming to minimize downtime.
