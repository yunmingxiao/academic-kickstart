Hi there! I am a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan working with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chenang/">Prof. Ang Chen</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2024, where my advisor was <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/website/index-a.html">Prof. Aleksandar Kuzmanovic</a>. Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2019. 

I am broadly interested in computer networks and systems. My current research focuses on enhancing the <a href="publication/?filtertopic=.pubtopic-0">security, privacy</a>, and <a href="publication/?filtertopic=.pubtopic-1">reliability</a> of Internet infrastructure and services. My research has received the Best Student Paper Award from EuroSys.
